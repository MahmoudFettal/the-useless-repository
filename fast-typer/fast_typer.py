    Description:
    Recently I have been trying to improve my typing speed and I have made some progress
    by reaching the 60 words per minute milestone, but when I saw the scoreboard I found
    a score of 250 words per minuteÂ so I decided to beat it XD

    In this python script, I used selenium to create a "bot" to destroy the scoreboard.
